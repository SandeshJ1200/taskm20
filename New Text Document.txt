2. Give a write-up on the Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.

Copy By Value

It is used to replace the value of an assigned variable, Only primitive datatypes are performed by copy by value 
for example:

var a=10;
var b=a;
console.log(a);


Copy By Reference

var arr1= [1,2,3]
var arr2=arr1;
console.log(arr2);

Used to replace/copy the string assigned to a variable
Non-Primitive Datatypes such as Objects, Arrays are performed by Copy by Reference
